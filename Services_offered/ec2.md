#EC2
It is service offered by AWS which allows us to create a virtual computer system with the operating system of our choice.<br/>
It also allows us to choose the hardware of our choice like the amount of storage we require or the RAM which is compatible to our needs.<br/>
It can be easily controlled by the user without worrying about the failure of resources.<br/>
The user only has to pay when the instance is running.<br/>
Once the work is done it can be easily turned off temporarily by the user or terminated permanently by the user.<br/>
