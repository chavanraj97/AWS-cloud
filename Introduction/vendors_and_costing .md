# Costing
Of the above mentioned companies all companies except Amazon(AWS) accept payment before offering the compute services to the client.<br/>
AWS strictly believes in **pay as you go** policy which means that we don't have to pay upfront before using any services. We are charged as we use the resources.<br/>
It is as simple as paying an internet bill.
The pay as you go policy has helped a lot of individual programmer and startup companies.<br/>
AWS in a way has saved startup companies from spending a huge chunk of their funding on cloud computing services.<br/>
