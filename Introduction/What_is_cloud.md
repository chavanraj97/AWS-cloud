# What is cloud
Cloud can be defined as computing resources which are taken on rent by an organization or an individual through a service provider like AWS.<br/>

The cloud service provider costs you according to the services that you're using. <br/>

For example:<br/>
	When you have a video in your laptop, it is stored in local memory and when you upload it on facebook it is stored in the cloud.<br/>
	
On AWS we can use a lot of services, of which storage is just a small part. <br/>
