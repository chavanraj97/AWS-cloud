# Models of cloud services
There are namely 3 models of cloud services which are as follows
1. SAAS (Software as a service)
1. PAAS (Platform as a service)
1. IAAS (Infrastructure as a service)<br/>


## SAAS
SAAS allows users to connect to and use cloud based application on the internet.<br/>
SAAS can be used without downloading any application in our local desktop and hence user is not responsible for updating the application.<br/>
Some common examples of SAAS are email, Tableu, Storm.<br/>

## PAAS
PAAS is a service which gives user a platform to develop and run application without worrying about the infrastructure of developement of the app.<br/>
User need not worry about the operating system, database and all the other things associated with hosting the application all of this is taken care of by the provider<br/>
Examples of this can be RDS service in AWS<br>

## IAAS
IAAS is a service which allows us to build a system from scratch with the requirements of our choice.<br/>
It basically provides us with a server, storage etc which is needed to build the infrastructure of the system.<br>
We can have the components which we actually require. <br>
It can be easily scaled up and down according to the requirement of the client.<br>

## Serverless
Serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure.<br>
With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.<br>
Note that serverless doesn't mean there does not exist a server, the server does exist but is just kept invisible to the user<br/>
This allows user to focus on the actual work rather than focusing on the infrastructure.
