# History of AWS
The AWS platform was launched in 2002 but back then it had minimalist tools. <br/>
In 2003 an Amazon worker introduced a computer infrastructure which can provide services such as storage.<br/>
Ec2 service was then introduced in 2004.<br/>
Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14, 2006, combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage, SQS, and EC2.<br/>
