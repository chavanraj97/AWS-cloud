# Types of Cloud<br/>
  There are 3 types of cloud which are mainly divided according to their privacy<br/>
- Private cloud <br/>
- Public cloud <br/>
- Hybrid cloud <br/>
    
## Private cloud
Private cloud is a cloud service which is owned by a particular company or an organization<br/>
This cloud computing service is not accessible to the outside world. <br/>
It is only accessible to the people of the organization to whom the rights are assigned by the company.<br/>
It can be managed by a 3rd party company but only for the use of the company whic owns it.


## Public cloud <br/>
Public cloud is a cloud which is owned by 3rd party company and can be used by any indivdual. This service is not owned by any company and <br/>
can be used by any particular individual, school, organization etc.<br/>.
An example of public cloud is ***Google drive***

## Hybrid cloud <br/>
Hybrid cloud is a mixture of both private and public clouds <br/>
It is all about consuming services from ones own private cloud and also having some services running on public cloud. <br/>
Consider if a big company name 'xyz' has its own private cloud service and still they are using google drive <br/>
to store their data then it is an example of hybrid cloud.
